## Roadmap for <ins>Mint</ins>
General (and quite simple) roadmap for **Mint**.

#### First Stage
- Implement Ball-Peen Hammer.
- Implement coins for every vanilla, **C&C**, **Oreganized**, and **Create** metal with dynamically changing textures dependant on stack sizes.
- Implement recipes for every coin using a Ball-Peen Hammer and a metal ingot or three metal nuggets.

#### Second Stage
- Implement Piggy Banks (coin storage that is per-player, like ender chests).

#### Third Stage
- **TerraFirmaCraft** compat.

#### Fourth Stage
- Actually implement the currency system, overriding emeralds as the standard currency in base Minecraft.
- Implement Numismatist villager profession.
